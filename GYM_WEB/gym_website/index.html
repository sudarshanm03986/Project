                Heya! My name is Andre Oreta, I am currently in my early 20's and I compete as a U93kg Junior. Currently, I am being coached and mentored by James Schroeder who is a well known powerlifting coach in New Zealand. James has taught me much in strength training and I am hoping to use these skills on both novice and veteran lifters alike.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                My educational background consists of a Certification in Personal Training and I am currently enrolled in the Bachelor of Sports and Exercise Science. My passion exists in the strength sports and more specifically, in powerlifting and overall strength development. I love seeing people gain strength and seeing the same passion spark in their eyes. My total time spent in the gym is nearing 5 years with my current total sitting comfortably at 700kg.
            </p>

            <p>
                My personal ambitions as a lifter extends out farther and I hope to make a name for myself at IPF Worlds and be competitive in my current weight class. As a coach, my ambition is to grow and develop as many lifters and having them be as strong as they possibly can and still break that limit further with them. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Outside of powerlifting, my interest lies in MMA, American Football, League, and Rugby Union. During my downtime, I usually like to be kept up to date on new knowledge in the fitness industry. I believe the more up to date I am, the more I can give to my clients.
            </p>
